    <string name="mine_BTC">When the BTC you mine reaches the withdrawal threshold, you can withdraw your BTC. Different withdrawal networks have different minimum withdrawal requirements, depending on the hash power you have. The more hash power, the faster BTC is generated. Additionally, blockchain transactions take some time, and even after a transaction request is made, it requires some time to complete.</string>

    <string name="real_Bitcoin">We are mining real BTC. All the actual computing power you own corresponds to real BTC miners in the cloud, which earn BTC for you.</string>

    <string name="paid_contract">All paid contracts are valid indefinitely.</string>

    <string name="spending_any_money">Of course, you can get our free mining rig, and by watching ads, you can also earn a lot of free hash power that will continuously mine BTC for you.</string>

    <string name="drop_suddenly">The hash rate might decrease because the free daily mining contracts and the ones obtained through ads each have an expiration of 8 hours and 24 hours, respectively. After they expire, the corresponding hash rate will decrease. The validity period starts from the moment each contract becomes active. For example, if you watch an ad now and receive a contract, it will expire at the same time tomorrow, lasting 24 hours. Apart from these cases, your hash rate shouldn\'t suddenly disappear.</string>

    <string name="lightning_network">We currently do not support invoice payments on the Lightning Network. Please enter your ZBD wallet\'s Gamer tag &amp; Lightning address in the withdrawal address field. At the moment, we only support the ZBD wallet, but we plan to support more wallets in the future.</string>

    <string name="APR_calculated">APR is a comprehensive calculation result. Overall, it depends on your mining efficiency, the production efficiency of BTC blocks, the price of BTC, as well as maintenance costs, electricity costs, and other factors. All these will affect the APR.</string>
